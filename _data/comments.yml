  comment: "This is a wonderful tutorial, made so clear and easy with all the screenshots\
    \ too. Not only does it introduce the reader to the state of the art in map technology\
    \ optimised for mobile (hence Leaflet, rather than Google or Openlayers), it also\
    \ nicely ties in other modules that should be part of every site builder&#39;s\
    \ repertoire, such as Display Suite and Feeds.\r\nGreat work! I&#39;ve added a\
    \ link to the IP Geolocation Views &amp; Maps, http://drupal.org/project/ip_geoloc\
    \ project page.\r\nAs a couple of options for those who want to take it even further,\
    \ I would recommend form some high-impact, low-hanging fruit the following:\r\n\
    o you can configure the Geofield distance calculation to be relative to the visitor&#39;s\
    \ location, as well as an address\r\no you can enable the Leaflet More Maps module\
    \ to instantly add 20+ available maps to just the one available through Leaflet\
    \ -- includes Bing and Google high-res\r\no you can add beautiful animated marker\
    \ clustering with the Leaflet Markercluster module\r\n"

  comment: Hello Rik! Thanks for taking the time to read my post and comment. I&#39;m
    so glad you created the IP Geolocation module. It&#39;s really good and user friendly.
    I&#39;m currently writing a post about how I set up my proximity search locator
    using IP Geolocation and Leaflet. Also, thanks in advance for taking charge of
    the Drupal 8 port for Leaflet, I really appreciate the work you&#39;re doing.
    :)

  comment: Content types come out of the box with Drupal. You can add content types
    by navigating to admin/structure/types/add on your Drupal site.

  comment: Hey, thanks for reading. I was kinda expecting people to ask why this site
    isn&#39;t on Drupal. But I feel that using Drupal for a simple blog is like using
    a Tsar Bomba to nuke a rat  :p
