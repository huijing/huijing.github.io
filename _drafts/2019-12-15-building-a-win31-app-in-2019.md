Oh, how time flies. Almost exactly 2 years ago, we had the first [Super Silly Hackathon](https://supersillyhackathon.sg/), and yesterday we had our third one. In case you're unfamiliar with the concept, it is a hackathon for people who want to build anything for no good reason.

It's a spin-off the original [“SF stupid shit no one needs and terrible ideas hackathon”](https://stupidhackathon.github.io/) but totally local, i.e. maxed-out Singlish.
