It's time for my annual Drupal project again. I had actually got my start in web development with Drupal and although I've left agency life, it seems that I'd still end up with at least one Drupal project a year. Largely because when someone needs a CMS, I tend to lean toward Drupal, it's like Linus and his blanket <span class="emoji" role="img" tabindex="0" aria-label="person shrugging">&#x1F937;</span>.

Sinvict Technology is a company that manufactures CNC (Computer Numerical Control) machinery, as well as repairs and servicing for those machines. With their main client base in the South-east Asia region, one of their key concerns was to have their website be performant on dodgy network connections, as their existing site was around 11mb and took 1 minute to load. (I know this because I checked it, to prove a point <span class="emoji" role="img" tabindex="0" aria-label="smiling face with horns">&#x1F608;</span>)

The site requirements were not overly complicated and I was also working with a designer I was familiar with, so things were a little smoother than if it was a complete stranger. Sinvict did not have an IT department, nor a dedicated staff member to be in charge of the website. Given such circumstances, I decided to host them on [Pantheon](https://pantheon.io/).
