Some of you might know that I run the [CSS meetup, Talk.CSS](https://singaporecss.github.io) in Singapore together with my best mate, [Wei](https://twitter.com/wgao19). If you didn't, you do now. Perhaps you have inferred that I really do love CSS. But you know what else I love? The 90s. More specifically, computing in the 90s.

I [wrote about this before]({{ site.url }}/blog/reminiscing-the-90s), on how the first computer I remember was a 486 in my living room and how I spent hours playing computer games running on MS-DOS and Windows 3.1. So it was inevitable that I would get on real well with [Kheng Meng](http://yeokhengmeng.com/), retro computing enthusiast and co-organiser of the [Hackware meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Hackware/).

We had worked together before at the inaugural [Super Silly Hackathon](https://supersillyhackathon.sg/) back in 2017 and found out that we [made a pretty good team]({{ site.url }}/blog/hardware-hacks-super-silly-hackathon). Being a hardware man and not really a web developer, I've never had good reason to get Kheng Meng to come for Talk.CSS.

That changed when I had another one of my many hare-brained schemes. Knowing that Kheng Meng was fully capable to setting up a working version of Windows 3.1, complete with networking capabilities and whatever applicable software I wanted, I asked him to set me up with an original version of Internet Explorer 3.

## Why Internet Explorer 3

Internet Explorer 3 was released in August, 1998,
