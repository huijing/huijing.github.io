My interest in language, writing systems and typography has led me to spend hours down a rabbit hole in search of answers to the plethora of “how/why did this come about?” questions that pop into my head at random. I may have an ”easily distracted” issue, but we're talking about that today <span class="emoji" role="img" tabindex="0" aria-label="smiling face with horns">&#x1F608;</span>.

As I was polishing up my talk for [You Gotta Love Frontend](https://yougottalovefrontend.com/), I started digging into digital font formats. Technically, I was trying to come up with an easy-to-explain definition for fonts. And I came across lots of good ones, which often make the contrast between fonts and typefaces, from [this article](http://fontfeed.com/archives/font-or-typeface/) by [Yves Peters](https://twitter.com/baldcondensed).

> ...the physical embodiment of a collection of letters, numbers, symbols, etc. (whether it’s a case of metal pieces or a computer file) is a **font**.  
—[Mark Simonson](https://twitter.com/marksimonson)

> **font** is what you use, and **typeface** is what you see.  
-[Norbert Florendo](http://www.typophile.com/node/13593)

Now that we've gotten that out of the way, I wanted to know how digital fonts worked.

In my mind, digital is transient, it is an encoding and manipulation of electronic signals. And as digital technology continues to progress (at a breakneck speed, might I add), we see less and less of the actual physical manifestations of it.
