If you were one of those kids that wondered why you had to attend all those math classes and learn about angles and algebra, well, so was I. I'll admit, I was too restless and easily bored to be a good student in a classroom setting. But as I got older, I realised that certain mathematical principles actually had practical applications in my day-to-day work (Not calculus though, I mean, I'm not an engineer or rocket scientist).

## Arithmetic

> Arithmetic is a branch of mathematics that deals with properties of the counting (and also whole) numbers and fractions and the basic operations applied to these numbers.

This seems unremarkably basic, but if you're doing any type of responsive design, and let's be honest, responsive design IS the norm nowadays, arithmetic is totally relevant to you. What does arithmetic have to do with design, you may ask? Plenty. But before that, let's talk about CSS units and values, because that's what we're going to be counting.

Numbers feature quite heavily in CSS, as property values, mostly. And the specification that covers this is the [CSS Values and Units Module Level 3](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-3/). The key function behind the arithmetic of CSS is the `calc()` function.
