If you were one of those kids that wondered why you had to attend all those math classes and learn about angles and algebra, well, so was I. I'll admit, I was too restless and easily bored to be a good student in a classroom setting. But as I got older, I realised that certain mathematical principles actually had practical applications in my day-to-day work (Not calculus though, I mean, I'm not an engineer or rocket scientist).
