November 24, 2016. The day I gave my first conference talk at [CSSConf.Asia](https://2016.cssconf.asia/).

June 3, 2017. The day I spoke at a conference outside of Singapore for the first time at [Webconf.asia](https://2017.webconf.asia/).

Time doesn't stand still. And dates are simply mental milestones we use to commemorate significant events in our lives. If you choose to take a rational view on this, it is simply our way of assigning meaning to a meaningless thing. But humans are not rational beings. And it is the most human thing, in my eyes, to remember the past.

I've been speaking internationally for 2 years now, and it still feels surreal every time I stand in front of an audience. And I still feel immense gratitude to organisers who bring me out. I don't think that will ever change, but if it does, someone please hit me with a mallet.

I had joined [Nexmo]()'s Developer Relations team last September and this was my first [DevRelCon](https://tokyo-2019.devrel.net/). My colleague, Myrsini, was giving a talk on [hackathons as an internal advocacy tool](https://youtu.be/TcG782Lc5NU) and I was simply tagging along as an attendee.

She did ask if I wanted to submit a lightning talk, but at that point, I figured I didn't know enough about DevRel to talk about anything useful. So I said, nope. But as fate would have it, I read the article, [The deadly truth about a world built for men – from stab vests to car crashes](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/feb/23/truth-world-built-for-men-car-crashes), just before heading out to the venue.

The content in that article touched a nerve and by the time I made it to the venue, I had this compulsion to submit a lightning talk topic on the value of sharing our perspectives.

Given how last minute this was, I didn't REALLY expect to have to give the talk. But during lunch, I found out that the submission was accepted, so it was game on from lunch until my slot at 5pm. 

I pulled together 20 slides, and went through the talk in my head a couple times to get the timing down just right because you do get “samurai-ed” off the stage if you go overtime (I love this idea, by the way).

Thankfully, the feedback I received was positive and here's [the transcript plus extended recap]() of the whole endeavour, if you're interested.

There were a surprising number of firsts with regards to conference speaking this year. And giving a talk at [CSSConf China](https://css.w3ctech.com/) was one of them. Not only because it was my first time in China since 2002, but also because it was my first time delivering a technical talk in Chinese.

I consider myself a native Chinese speaker, but it's one thing to converse about everyday things and quite another to stand on stage and talk about CSS and web technologies. Luckily for me, the fates blessed me by allowing me to cross paths with [Wei](https://twitter.com/wgao19).

You know how you meet someone and even though you've just met, you feel like you've known them for years? That's how I felt (I don't know how she feels about all this, go ask her yourself). I literally asked her the question “OMG, where have you been all my life?” multiple times.

Anyway, she's originally from Beijing and kindly offered to vet my transcript for the talk, fixing all the ridiculous errors that arise from a person who clearly hasn't used formal language in a long time.

CSSConf China was a great experience. It was a community-focused conference with more than 300 attendees. There was one English talk by [Brian Birtles](https://twitter.com/brianskold), while the rest were all in Chinese. Every single speaker was brilliant. What I found fascinating was how each of their unique personalities really shone through on stage.

I was totally chuffed for the opportunity to meet my long-time CSS idol, [袁川](https://twitter.com/yuanchuan23), in person, and his talk was one of the most mindblowing talks I'd ever seen. Not just the content, but the delivery of it. He is very soft-spoken, and fairly shy. But he epitomises how sometimes, the most quiet voices speak the loudest.

If you don't understand Chinese, here's my unprofessional attempt at translating the talk: [https://generative-art-with-css.commons.host/](https://generative-art-with-css.commons.host/).

It was really cool to meet a few of the most well-known names in the Chinese frontend community like [大漠](https://www.w3cplus.com/), [赵锦江 (AKA 勾三股四)](https://jiongks.name/), [张鑫旭](https://www.zhangxinxu.com/), [程劭非 (AKA Winter)](https://github.com/wintercn) and [贺师俊 (AKA Hax)](http://johnhax.net/). Fun fact, 锦江 has now relocated to Singapore and is having fun with us.

My Nexmo DevRel colleague and fellow [Mozilla TechSpeaker](https://events.mozilla.org/techspeakers), [Alex Lakatos](https://twitter.com/lakatos88), is Romanian and happened to live in Cluj for a bit. I had never been to Romania before, but I already had friends there, largely because of TechSpeakers.

[JSHeroes](https://jsheroes.io/) was a 2-day single track conference with 23 speakers, many of whom were friends I had met previously at other conferences, so it was nice to catch up with them. 

There was a lot of amazing content packed into 48 hours (less if you count the actual conference time). This Romania trip also marked the beginning of my sort-of-nuts summer conference schedule for 2019.

I was sort of jet-lagged when I got there and when [Sarah Drasner](https://twitter.com/sarah_edo) introduced me to [Simona Cotin](https://twitter.com/simona_cotin), who is one of the sweetest people you'll ever meet, I FORGOT MY OWN NAME for about 3 seconds. One of many facepalm moments in my life.

My talk was near the end of the second day, which meant I couldn't really enjoy the conference fully because of that nagging worry about my own talk at the back of my mind. I was doing my web typography talk, which has been remixed and built upon over the past 2 years, and remains one of my favourite talks to give.

Largely because this is a talk that allows me a lot of room for localisation, to make it more relevant to the audience I'm speaking to. The research into the language, culture and history of whichever country I'm doing the talk in is one of the greatest benefits of this particular topic.

I had a true Cluj local, Alex, on my side, and he taught me how to open my talk with specific words that only Cluj people use. So when I opened with “Mno servus oameni buni”, I received the most amazing response from the audience of 700. And I hadn't even said anything of worth yet.

Another highlight was [Madalina Tantareanu](https://twitter.com/Madalinadraws), who made live sketchnotes of every speaker's talk. The entire process was projected on a side screen, which was really cool. JSHeroes was a really cool experience and I definitely recommend it to anyone who's near the region to attend.

Technically, this isn't a talk about CSS. In fact, the talk I gave was the first non-CSS talk I ever delivered on a conference stage.
