The latest episode of [Jen Simmons'](http://jensimmons.com/) wonderful podcast [The Web Ahead](http://thewebahead.net/101) featured content strategist [Eileen Webb](http://webmeadow.com/). Good stuff from start to finish, you should really check it out. There was one particular point that resonated with me, when they talked about user experience of people whose job is to add content to the website.

>Not to get super philosophical, but capitalism isn't really keen on improving working conditions for employees. It's not super excited about spending money and energy on making things nicer for the people who you are paying.  
― Eileen Webb on The Web Ahead

Drupal comes with a lot of out-of-the-box functionality that can help make the content editing experience less confusing, provided we, as developers, use them. Placing an emphasis on the content authoring experience will undoubtedly impact the way we build our sites, but I believe this is for the better. And I'm not the only one, which is why Drupal 8 will be shipping with a [plethora of improvements](http://wimleers.com/article/drupal-8-structured-content-authoring-experience) on the content authoring front.

But let's talk about Drupal 7 for now. I am definitely guilty of occasionally building functionality in a way that made things easy for me as a developer but complicated things for the content editor. In hindsight, I've realised that such decisions were short-sighted and usually came back to bite me later on. If I can help make the content editors' lives easier, they're more willing to use and explore the system on their own. It also means less support tickets for me to resolve. 

###Take time to plan the content model

###Provide clear instructions in the help text
