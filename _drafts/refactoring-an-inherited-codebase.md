So for 2018, I got myself some gainful employment doing full-time frontend development work. You know, the kind where you go to an office, and have colleagues and bosses? Also, pay cheques and CPF (that's the Singapore equivalent of a retirement fund), love those.

Anyhow, one of my responsibilities was the refactoring and cleanup of the frontend codebase for the company's existing products. It's not that I've never refactored codebases before, half my career was built on refactoring legacy projects, but these were a bit larger and messier than my previous projects.
