Over the course of this year, I've gone over to [Wei](https://uuei.io/)'s workplace numerous times to disturb her and her colleagues during their internal sharing, not to be confused with the community meetup, [React Knowledgeable](https://reactknowledgeable.org/). I think the internal sharing's unofficial name is RK Originals, maybe. Who knows?

Sometimes I just sit there and do nothing, other times, I talk about stuff. The last thing I talked about was the [Web Speech API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API), which stemmed from one of the many stupid ideas I have. Basically, I wanted to yell at my browser and make it change colours on a website.

It was for the 4th anniversary of [Talk.CSS](https://singaporecss.github.io/45/).

What do you mean, why?

So anyway, [stupid website](https://singaporecss.github.io/colour-speech/) was built, and the yelling worked. I had to yell because until today, I have no idea where the microphone is on my MacBook. <span class="kaomoji">¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯</span>

During the talk, we messed around with the different options for voices (and hence accents), but we soon found that other than English, the options for other languages were limited.

Which led me to dig a little deeper into how international the Web Speech API actually is.

## What is this Web Speech API?

The Web Speech API is not a web standard, it is a community report developed and published by the [Speech API Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/speech-api/), with the first draft released by in 2012.

According to [the document](https://wicg.github.io/speech-api/), this API is meant to:

> enable developers to use scripting to generate text-to-speech output and to use speech recognition as an input for forms, continuous dictation and control

Speech recognition in the browser. We can do something with that. Browser APIs are essentially Javascript. Which is why an idiot like me who never went to school for Computer Science, can somehow cobble together projects that go beyond just a webpage.

I love the web.

But upon some further research, I soon realised that speech-to-text is not like text-to-speech. It is slightly more complicated.

The Speech to Text section of [Google's privacy whitepaper](https://www.google.com/chrome/privacy/whitepaper.html#speech) states that:

> Chrome supports the Web Speech API, a mechanism for converting speech to text on a web page. It uses Google's servers to perform the conversion. Using the feature sends an audio recording to Google (audio data is not sent directly to the page itself), along with the domain of the website using the API, your default browser language and the language settings of the website. Cookies are not sent along with these requests. 

## Making my browser understand my yelling

In a bid to get myself familiarised with this whole voice interface situation that everyone has been raving about for years, I decided to do what many web developers seem to gravitate toward. I built a website (I don't know what constitutes an app so <span class="kaomoji">¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯</span>).

Specifically, I built a website I can yell CSS at. Okay, slightly untrue. I technically am yelling colours at the website, but named colours are legitimate CSS values, so…

This didn't require too much work because CSS values are by default in English (as with practically all programming languages). Speech-to-text quality for the English language is probably the most spot-on around, I'm guessing.
