I've had quite a start to 2018, largely due to my tendency to “say yes, worry later”, which has both served me well yet sometimes makes me question my intelligence. So in January 2018, I became gainfully employed full-time, organised a [half-day CSS conference](https://singaporecss.github.io/24/), spoke at [JSConf.Asia](https://2018.jsconf.asia/) and conducted a workshop on CSS grid there as well.

Can you understand why I tell my friends I'm an idiot who is incapable of checking her calendar now? Anyhow, over Christmas, I got to know a bunch of friends who just graduated from one of the many bootcamp programs here in Singapore.

This particular bootcamp apparently did not place much emphasis on front-end technologies as they did not cover Javascript and mainly used Bootstrap as their CSS solution for all their projects.

Me when I heard this: <span class="emoji" role="img" tabindex="0" aria-label="cursing face">&#x1F92C;</span>

If you don't know me, just know that I really, really dislike pre-canned CSS frameworks. I do agree every project ought to have their own customised CSS framework, but we'll talk about that another day.

The TLDR version of things is that, since I was holding a CSS grid workshop for JSConf.Asia, why not get two of them to be my co-facilitators, and I'd just give them a crash course on CSS layout beforehand? Just another one of my hare-brained schemes <span class="emoji" role="img" tabindex="0" aria-label="person shrugging">&#x1F937;</span>.

**Conclusion: CSS grid is intuitive to new-comers, and will change the way we teach web layouts moving forward.**
