*This post will be constantly updated as 2018 progresses.*

Last year was the first time I spoke at any event outside of Singapore, and it was quite a whirlwind experience. I absolutely LOVED every minute of it, and did a recap of the [Mozilla Developer Asia Roadshow]({{ site.url }}/blog/talking-about-talking-css/) where I met a lot of amazing and interesting people. It's fair to say that 2017 was an incredible year for me.

My strategy for submitting call-for-proposals (CFPs) is: I have none. I try to submit whenever I see an open call, and hope for the best. I actually expect rejection most of the time because, let's be honest, it's a numbers game. Organisers receive hundreds, probably thousands of applications, and it's so narrow it down to just a handful.

So whenever I get the rare, “Congratulations, your talk has been accepted” reply, I don't think twice and just say yes (let's ignore the fact I don't think much in general). Because I feel like if I don't say yes now, I will NEVER get the opportunity ever again.

I [wrote a little bit about this]({{ site.url }}/blog/musings-on-speaking-at-conferences/) last year after a conversation with my good friend, [Aysha](https://aysha.me/), that opportunities for speakers from Southeast-Asia aren't exactly falling out of the sky. And I can't put into words how appreciative I am to the various conference organisers for giving me the chance to speak at their events.

Which brings us to my conference schedule for 2018. We've established that I don't think very much before making decisions, which explains exactly how I ended up an exciting month of June. I'm not complaining though, because I'm having the time of my life.

Ah, the conference that started it all. I first attended CSSConf.Asia in 2014, and it was such an experience. I hadn't started speaking yet, but the thought of being on stage did cross my mind. This is my fourth year being involved with CSSConf.Asia/JSConf.Asia in some capacity, and I hope this streak continues on.

First talk of 2018! This is the talk that sent me around the world, it's about vertical writing on the web. I'm very grateful that a number of conference organisers decided to pick it up and let me do this talk in front of audiences around the world.

Doing this talk in front of a “home” crowd felt a bit special, though. As usual, before the talk, I'm on conference duty.
