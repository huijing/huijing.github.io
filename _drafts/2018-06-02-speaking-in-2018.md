*This post will be constantly updated as 2018 progresses.*

Last year was the first time I spoke at any event outside of Singapore, and it was quite a whirlwind experience. I absolutely LOVED every minute of it, and did a recap of the [Mozilla Developer Asia Roadshow]({{ site.url }}/blog/talking-about-talking-css/) where I met a lot of amazing and interesting people. So why not do it again for 2018?

My strategy for submitting call-for-proposals (CFPs) is: **I have none**. I try to submit whenever I see an open call, and hope for the best. I actually expect rejection most of the time because, let's be honest, it's a numbers game. Organisers receive hundreds, probably thousands of applications, and it's so narrow it down to just a handful.

So whenever I get the rare, “*Congratulations, your talk has been accepted*” reply, I don't think twice and just say yes (let's ignore the fact I don't think much in general). Because I feel like if I don't say yes now, I will **NEVER** get the opportunity ever again.

I [wrote a little bit about this]({{ site.url }}/blog/musings-on-speaking-at-conferences/) last year after a conversation with my good friend, [Aysha](https://aysha.me/), that opportunities for speakers from Southeast-Asia aren't exactly falling out of the sky. And I can't put into words how appreciative I am to the various conference organisers for giving me the chance to speak at their events.

Which brings us to my conference schedule for 2018. We've established that I don't think very much before making decisions, which explains exactly how I ended up an exciting month of June. I'm not complaining though, because I'm having the time of my life. <span class="emoji" role="img" tabindex="0" aria-label="smiling face with sunglasses">&#x1F60E;</span>

## <span class="emoji" role="img" tabindex="0" aria-label="Singapore">&#x1F1F8;&#x1F1EC;</span> @ Talk.CSS max-content

We can look at Talk.CSS max-content either as an expanded meet-up or a mini-conference, two sides of the same oreo. This was the first time Talk.CSS sold tickets because we were flying in a speaker from Australia, giving out some swag and putting up some semblance of promotional material. Okay, it was 2 banners, stop judging.

Although this year's format for JSConf.Asia involved folding in all the CSS talks into the 3-day extravaganza, we still wanted a sort of CSS-themed event, so by the power of relationships (mostly Chris's), we managed to get 2 fabulous speakers all the way from Australia, [Mandy Michael]() and [Andy Clarke]().

I closed the event with my first sort-of non-technical talk, which was basically a love letter to the web. But overall, it was a surprisingly successful event. Full write-up [here]().

## <span class="emoji" role="img" tabindex="0" aria-label="Singapore">&#x1F1F8;&#x1F1EC;</span> @ JSConf.Asia 2018

Ah, the conference that started it all. I first attended CSSConf.Asia in 2014, and it was such an experience. I hadn't started speaking yet, but the thought of being on stage did cross my mind. This is my fourth year being involved with CSSConf.Asia/JSConf.Asia in some capacity, and I hope this streak continues on.

First conference talk of 2018! This is the talk that sent me around the world, it's about vertical writing on the web. I'm very grateful that a number of conference organisers decided to pick it up and let me do this talk in front of audiences around the world.

Doing this talk in front of a “home” crowd felt a bit special, though. As usual, before the talk, I'm on conference duty, manning the T-shirt booth but somehow ended up surrounded with boxes of bottled water.

It's a known fact that I don't adult in general, but sometimes there are exceptions, like when I have to go on stage. Because even I, have standards. I think I got a few double-takes when walking back into the theatre, like “*wait, wasn't that the angry t-shirt booth lady?*” (there's a story to the ‘angry’ bit, ask me about it, if you like). <span class="emoji" role="img" tabindex="0" aria-label="person shrugging">&#x1F937;</span>

This being the second time I've ever been on stage at the Capitol Theatre, I already knew what it would feel like. The spotlight made it nearly impossible to see the audience, and I found this rather amusing because it felt like I was talking to myself. <span class="emoji" role="img" tabindex="0" aria-label="ROFL">&#x1F923;</span>

I was told I looked professional, which is hilarious, but I have since decided to call my on-stage apparel choices “Cinderella mode”, because it only lasts all of 3 seconds before I revert to “Pumpkin mode”, which is what all my friends see all the time. See exhibit below:

</figure>

There's a story to this. Long story short, the projector was so blur we had to replace it with a huge TV instead. Unfortunately, cable lengths were not sufficient, and rather than do a lot of furniture shifting, I decided that shifting myself would be the most efficient thing to do. To the floor! Also, I'm all of 5 years old and when I see a nice carpet, I must sit on it. Sans shoes.

</figure>

I was informed by my fellow workshop facilitators that the event photographer was perplexed for a while because all he could here was my disembodied voice, however, he could not see where I was at all.

I honestly had no idea why anyone would sign up for my workshop, but thankfully the attendees were sufficiently interested in CSS Grid to disregard my unorthodox approach. I'll try to be more adult in my next workshop. Maybe.

## <span class="emoji" role="img" tabindex="0" aria-label="Remote">&#x1F310;</span> @ Mozilla Tech Briefing

This was the first time I ever did a talk over video conference, and it was quite fun. Because I had some bits of live coding on the presentation, my slides were full screen on my computer, and I couldn't see the other participants on the video call, which was interesting.

But this was also memorable because not long after, I officially joined the [Mozilla TechSpeakers](https://wiki.mozilla.org/TechSpeakers) initiative, which made it easier to explain my relationship with Mozilla. As previously, it was, how should we put this, complicated.

## <span class="emoji" role="img" tabindex="0" aria-label="Singapore">&#x1F1F8;&#x1F1EC;</span> @ GitHub Constellation

It was the first time GitHub Constellation was run in Singapore this year. I had heard plans for this the year before but somehow it didn't come through. I was connected to the organiser of this event by Mozilla and was asked to speak about CSS layout, which is just up my alley.

The only thing was that the event took place at a rooftop bar kind of setting, which was a great location for networking but the acoustics of the place was a bit tricky for an event involving a bunch of talks. It also wasn't really set up for talks, it was more of a live band performance stage thing. So there was no way to display both slides and speaker notes.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/24vLH3MC4bc?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Good thing this was a subject I could talk for hours on end, not so good is that without speaker notes, I'm not as tight with time. So I sort of breezed through the final few slides but it was a cool experience all around.

## <span class="emoji" role="img" tabindex="0" aria-label="United States of America">&#x1F1FA;&#x1F1F8;</span> @ Smashing Conference SF 2018

Being invited to speak at Smashing Conf was such a wonderful opportunity, and it was my first time speaking to a predominantly American audience. But being on the Mozilla Developer Roadshow the year before meant that I was already familiar with [Vitaly Friedman](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/speaker/vitaly-friedman/) (who I seem to bump into all the time <span class="emoji" role="img" tabindex="0" aria-label="grinning face with smiling eyes">&#x1F601;</span>) and [Markus](https://twitter.com/indysigner).

And because it was in San Francisco, I got also arrange to meet a number of people whom I'd only ever interacted with online. Me, being me, found accommodation in San Francisco unacceptably exorbitant, so just before I left for San Francisco, I decided to pop down to San Diego for 3 nights before heading up to Mountain View to visit the Mozilla office.

I still think that was a great decision, because San Diego was a lovely city. I got to meet [Saron](https://twitter.com/saronyitbarek) , creator of [CodeNewbie](https://www.codenewbie.org/) and such an inspirational and driven woman. That was one of the most fun conversations I've ever had, and I really hope to meet her again. Some day.

The Mozilla office visit was super fun, even though I dropped in on a Friday afternoon, when it was much quieter than usual, but [Havi Hoffman](https://twitter.com/freshelectrons), whom I had met in December at the Mozilla All-Hands showed me around and introduced me to the Mozillians around the office.

AND we got to play with VR ducks! 

I museum a lot, even back home in Singapore. So I couldn't possibly find myself in Mountain View without visiting the Computer History Musuem, and it was every bit as good as I imagined (if not better). Another highlight was meeting [Robin Rendle](https://robinrendle.com/) in person while I was in San Franciso and he gave me the best recommendation to visit the [Letterform Archive](https://letterformarchive.org/), best advice ever.

Finally, it was time to get serious. The team at Smashing really know how to do a conference, and the line-up was stellar. I got to meet [Rachel Andrew](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/) again, and a lot of new friends doing cool stuff. Had nice long conversations with [Joe Leech](https://mrjoe.uk/) and [Mike Rithmuller](https://www.madebymike.com.au/). And I met the lady who campaigned for and created the dumpling emoji, [Lu Yiying](http://www.yiyinglu.com/)!

## <span class="emoji" role="img" tabindex="0" aria-label="Ukraine">&#x1F1FA;&#x1F1E6;</span> @ You Gotta Love Frontend Kyiv

This marked the start of my ridiculous summer conference schedule. Ridiculous because instead of remaining in Europe, I ping-ponged back and forth between Singapore and the various European cities. But looking back, in spite of it being a bit hectic, the timing was just right, and I managed to touch down back to Singapore and make it to the final game of our basketball season. We won. <span class="emoji" role="img" tabindex="0" aria-label="smiling face with sunglasses">&#x1F60E;</span>

So apparently, this was the first time the team in Kyiv organised a conference, but honestly, you'd never have known because the entire conference was so well-run. I was really well taken care of as a speaker, and that line-up was amazing. I learned so much in the short span of 2 days.

Being at CSSConf.EU and JSConf.EU was so surreal. It's an experience to remember.

## <span class="emoji" role="img" tabindex="0" aria-label="The Netherlands">&#x1F1F3;&#x1F1F1;</span> @ CSS Day 2018

I was especially nervous for this talk for a number of reasons. It was a brand new talk, I hadn't had that much time to work on it, and I was told the CSS Day audience was very technical, so I was doubly worried that I would be telling them things they already knew.

Is doing 3 different talks within the span of a month a bad idea? Well, now that I've come out the other side relatively unscathed, I'll say it's hectic, but rewarding. Although I never really relaxed until this talk was over and I could take a breath without thinking about the next talk (at least for a little bit).
