I've been helping to mentor a [Coding Girls](http://css.codinggirls.sg/) initiative called 30 days of CSS and one of the first projects involved [creating a heart shape from pure CSS](https://css-tricks.com/books/volume-i/make-heart-shape/). The code is fairly short, and makes use of the `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements. 

```html
<div class="heart"></div>
```

```css
.heart {
  background-color: red;
  height: 30px;
  width: 30px;
  transform: rotate(-45deg);
}

.heart::before,
.heart::after {
  content: '';
  background-color: red;
  height: 30px;
  width: 30px;
  position: absolute;
  border-radius: 50%;
}

.heart::before {
  top: -15px;
  left: 0;
}
```
But if we follow the code exactly as above, we will soon realise something is wrong. I cannot say for sure, but I'm suspecting the tutorial wasn't meant to be published as it was. Here's the result of what the code looks like if we followed along exactly.

<figure>
  <figcaption>Something is not quite right here (note that additional styles have been applied to position the heart in the centre of the page)</figcaption>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/css-pseudo/original.jpg" srcset="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/css-pseudo/original@2x.jpg 2x" alt="Incorrect end result">
</figure>

The fix requires the addition of one more rule-set:

```css
.heart::after {
  left: 15px;
}
```
But for a code walkthrough targeted at beginners to CSS, there's quite a lot to unpack from this example alone. So let's break it all down.

## The <div> element

Most of us never give it a second thought, but `<div>` elements are among the most common things we will ever see on the web, so let's get to know it a little better. The `<div>` element is classified as *flow content*, and has no special meaning.

In the specification, it is highlighted that authors use the `<div>` element when no other element is suitable, as use of more appropriate elements provide better accessibility for readers and easier maintainability for authors.

<figure>
    <figcaption>I guess someone didn't get the memo here</figcaption>
    <img srcset="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/css-pseudo/divs-480.jpg 480w, {{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/css-pseudo/divs-640.jpg 640w, {{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/css-pseudo/divs-960.jpg 960w, {{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/css-pseudo/divs-1280.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, (max-width: 960px) 75vw, 640px" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/css-pseudo/divs-640.jpg" alt="An incredible div soup full of divs and nested divs">
</figure>

When it comes to how the element is visually laid out on a web page, as with any element in the document, there is a process of box generation according to the visual formatting model. A key property determining the nature of the box generated by an element is its `display` property.

There is nowhere in the specification, either for HTML or CSS that determines what this value should be for a `<div>` element. The initial value of `display` in the CSS specification is `inline`. I don't know about you, but when I first learnt web development, I read that block-level elements included, `<p>`, `<div>`, `<ul>` and a whole list of others, while anything that was not on the list was inline-level.

Turns out, this is behaviour determined by the user-agent stylesheet of the browsers we use. If we refer to the specification on [CSS Cascading and Inheritence Level 3](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-3/), there is a section explaining [how the cascade is prioritised](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-3/#cascading). Under normal circumstances, author declarations will take precedence over user declarations which, in turn, take precendence over user agent declarations.

<p class="note">Fun fact, we can view the user-agent stylesheet for Firefox fairly easily via DevTools. If we go to the <em>Computed</em> tab and filter for the <code>display</code> property with the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element highlighted, odds are we will see the source of this style is from a file called <em>html.css</em>. Click on that and we should end up opening a file at the following url: <em>view-source:resource://gre-resources/html.css</em>. For the other browsers, some digging is required online for <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/blink/+/master/Source/core/css/html.css">Chromium</a> and <a href="https://trac.webkit.org/browser/trunk/Source/WebCore/css/html.css">Webkit</a>.</p>

Because the `<div>` element has its `display` set to `block`, we are able to apply `width` and `height` properties to it. Applying a `width` and `height` to inline elements has no effect. The [width of an inline element](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visudet.html#the-width-property) is determined by the rendered content within it, while the [height of an inline element](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visudet.html#inline-non-replaced) is based on the font used.

<figure>

  <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/css-pseudo/box-model.svg" style="max-height:15em" alt="The box model">
</figure>

The background refers to the background of the content, padding and border areas, while margins will always be transparent. One thing to note is that background properties are not inherited, but because the initial value of `background-color` is `transparent`, the background colour of the parent element tends to be visible unless the child elements completely fill up the parent element and have their own background colour set.

## Pseudo-elements

The `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements in this example are used to form the rounded tops of a heart shape. Pseudo-elements, according to [the specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/REC-selectors-3-20181106/#pseudo-elements), represent abstract elements of the document beyond those explicitly created by the document language.

Pseudo-elements may also provide authors a way to refer to content that does not exist in the source document. This is specifically applicable to the `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements.

The use of double semi-colons, `::`, is to distinguish between pseudo-classes (single colon) and pseudo-elements. However, for compatability with older browsers, the single semi-colon syntax is still valid. There are more pseudo-elements than `::before` and `::after` but with regards to this code example, I will only talk about these 2.

Let's use the `<div>` element with the `.heart` CSS class in this explanation. As mentioned, `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements are used to insert generated content before or after an element's content. The `.heart::before` and `.heart::after` pseudo-elements are children of the `.heart` element.

```html
<div class="heart">
  ::before
  If there was any text content, it would be here
  ::after
</div>
```
Inspecting the `.heart` element with DevTools will reveal the above structure. If there were text content within the `.heart` element, it would exist at the same level as `::before` and `::after`, situated between the two. In order to generate content, the pseudo-elements **must** have the `content` property assigned. The content can be an empty string, e.g. `''`.

The `display` property is non-inheritable. Given the initial value of `display` is inline, unless explicitly set, the `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements will be inline elements. However, we can always change this value by setting the `display` of the pseudo-elements to something else, e.g. `block` or `inline-block`.

## The `border-radius` property

This is the go-to property for creating rounded corners. Before this property came along, it was a huge hassle to have rounded corners on the web. The most common usage setting a single value for the `border-radius` property. 

But `border-radius` is actually shorthand for all four `border-*-radius` properties (top, right, bottom, left). Each individual `border-*-radius` can take 2 values, the former for the horizontal radius and the latter for the verical radius.

<img style="max-width:20em" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/math-for-fed/border-radius.svg" alt="Border radius values">

Both fixed units (e.g. `px` and `rem`) and relative units (e.g. `%`) can be used. When we use percentages, the horizontal radius will be a percentage of the **width** of the border box while the vertical radius will be a percentage of the **height** of the border box.

With that in mind, to form a perfect circle, we would set a `border-radius: 50%` on an element that has an equal height and width. In this example, we could have set `border-radius: 15px` to create our perfect circles as well.

## Positioning

The pseudo-elements also have their `position` set to `absolute`. In the absolute positioning model, a box is explicitly offset with respect to its containing block. For the example we are using, this means the offset of the 2 pseudo-elements is relative to the `.heart` element.

Within normal flow, `width` and `height` have no effect on inline elements, but once an inline element has been positioned absolutely, it behaves like an absolutely positioned block element, which means we can set its `width` and `height` properties.

Because we have assigned a fixed height and width of 30px for the `.heart` element and its pseudo-element children, we can offset the circular children halfway out of the parent square on adjacent sides to form the heart shape.

For this example, we will go with the top side and the right side. Offsetting the `::before` pseudo-element up the top requires a `top: -15px` negative value while offsetting the `::after` pseudo-element out the right side will require a `left: 15px`.

## Transforms

Transforms are a rather interesting CSS property to explore. The visual formatting model describes a coordinate system, within which, elements are positioned. Transforms allow us [to modify this coordinate space](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-transforms-1/), allowing us to translate, rotate and scale the elements in question. These effects, however, are applied **after** the elements have been sized and positioned.

This means that the rest of the elements within the document recognise the original size and position of the element within the normal flow of content, not its transformed size and/or position. So there may or may not be instances of overlap/underlap between the transformed element and the rest of the content.

Other than the transform property itself, which allows a wide variety of 2d and 3d transforms, there is also the `transform-origin` property that determines the starting point for these transformations. The default value of `transform-origin` is `50% 50%`, which means the transformation's starting point is the centre of the element.

For this example, only one transformation is being used.

```css
.heart {
  transform: rotate(-45deg)
}
```

This rotates our red square 45 degrees in the anti-clockwise direction. In the first screenshot of this article, if I had left the red square without adjusting it to the centre of the screen, we would have found the top edges of the square spilling out of the viewport on the left and top respectively.

<img style="max-width:20em" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/css-pseudo/rotate.svg" alt="How the heart got rotated">

If you're interested in a more detailed explanation of 2D transforms, I [wrote something up a while ago]({{ site.url }}/blog/basics-of-css-transforms/), but it's still relevant.

## The `:hover` pseudo-class and transition property

[Pseudo-classes](https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/REC-selectors-3-20181106/#pseudo-classes) are keywords added to a selector that specifies a special **state** of the selected element. For example, `:hover` occurs when your mouse is moved over the element, `:first-child` occurs when the element is the first child element within a parent element.

If we wanted our heart to change colour when the cursor hovers over it, we would need to set a different background colour for the `.heart:hover` selector, as well as its child elements. Currently, it is **not** possible to apply a pseudo-class like `:hover` to pseudo-elements. However, we can apply the `:hover` on the `.heart` element, then trigger the effect on the pseudo-elements.

```css
/* This is valid */
.heart:hover,
.heart:hover::before,
.heart:hover::after {
  background-color: maroon;
}
```
```css
/* This is NOT valid */
.heart:hover,
.heart::before:hover,
.heart::after:hover {
  background-color: maroon;
}
```
For grouped selectors, as long as 1 of the selectors is invalid, the whole block is invalid. This means if you chose to group the selectors as shown above, the second block of code will be completely invalid, even though `.heart:hover` is a proper selector.

For a smooth transition between the 2 colours, we can use the `transition` property. The `transition` property is a shorthand for the four individual transition properties of `transition-property`, `transition-duration`, `transition-timing-function` and `transition-delay`.

The syntax for the `transition` property is as follows:

```css
transition: <single-transition>#
where <single-transition> = [ none | <single-transition-property> ] || <time> || <timing-function> || <time> 
```
What this means is that the `<single-transition>` can occur 1 or many times, where multiple values are comma-separated. The `<single-transition>` represents at least 1 or more of the individual transition properties listed above. Because there are 2 time values involved, the first value that can be parsed as a time will always be assigned as the `transition-duration` while the second time value will be `transition-delay`.

```css
/* property name | duration */
transition: background-color 1s;

/* property name | duration | delay */
transition: background-color 1s 3s;

/* property name | duration | timing function */
transition: background-color 1s ease-out;

/* property name | duration | timing function | delay */
transition: background-color 1s ease-out 3s;
```
Although it is possible to not have a single time value for the `transition` property, it does not make sense to do so, because the end result is an abrupt change rather than a transition between states, as the initial values for both `transition-duration` and `transition-delay` are `0s`. The default value for `transition-property` is `all`, which implies all animatable properties will be transitioned when their values change.

Specific to this heart example, it is safe to just animate the `background-color` property on hover, so we can add the following to the `.heart` element and its 2 pseudo-element children.

```css
.heart {
  transition: background-color 1s;
}

.heart::before,
.heart::after {
  transition: background-color 1s;
}
```
By choosing not to include a `transition-timing-function`, the transition will take on the initial value of `ease`.

A pure CSS heart that changes colour when a cursor hovers over it may only take less than 30 lines of CSS, but every line has a part to play. The collective power of CSS properties used in combination is what allows us to create so many interesting designs on the web.

Why not try your hand at creating some pure CSS art as well? It might give you a clearer understanding of what your CSS properties of choice can really do.
