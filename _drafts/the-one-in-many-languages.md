I've always heard that Drupal did multi-language well, but you know when you hear about something and think, I know of it, but I don't know much else about it? That's exactly how multi-lingual Drupal was for me. Until we got to work on the [SFO China site](http://www.flysfo.cn/).

At the time, the main SFO site was a single-language implementation. There was some form of multi-language support, but it did not take advantage of Drupal's multi-lingual infrastructure. We were brought in to build the entire Chinese language site, as well as ensure the infrastructure was in place so additional languages could be implemented easily.
