challenge of digital transformation
politics, something we don't openly talk about but need to acknowledge
affects budget and resources
large number of people to get buy in
the importance of design communication
must have both great design skills and excellent persuasion techniques
converting from paper to digital
need to have experienced strong ux leads in charge
why? because requirements gathering, distill feedback and make executive decisions on prioritisation
consider the implications of decisions on working level
goes beyond the system itself, consider the time taken to fill forms, consider if everyone has access to terminals, performance of the system affects productivity
a system that is limited in functionality affects productivity
haven't found an effective replacement for pen and paper
form design is ux
do the people making executive decisions use the platform itself?
boils down to culture
