For the bulk of my web career, I've worked exclusively on the client-side of things. Designing responsive layouts, creating visualisations from large amounts of data, building application dashboards etc. But I never really had to deal with routing or HTTP requests directly. Until recently. This post is a write-up of how I learnt about server-side web development in Node.js, and a brief comparison of 3 popular Node.js frameworks.
