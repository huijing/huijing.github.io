This is another “refactoring legacy code” post, and I suspect you'll see more of these in the months to come. Like I said in a previous post, I've decided to do a bit more adulting and took on some gainful employment. A major part of the role I took is janitorial duties of the existing code base.

I say *janitorial* with a lot of love. There are, in my opinion, two kinds of developers around, one who loves creating cool stuff that sort of works and ships these new apps like people change underwear. And then there's the kind who comes in after the crowds have gone home, and the lights have been turned off, and refactors that code into something solid, writes documentation and basically sweeps up after the party.

I'm the second kind of developer. Look, who doesn't like playing with the new stuff? Most of us probably do. Maybe. But I find genuine comfort in refactoring and clean up work. Because I'm a weird person. Keep that in mind if you ever meet me in person.
