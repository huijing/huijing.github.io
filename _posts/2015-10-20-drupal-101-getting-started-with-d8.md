For people who may not be entirely familiar with the software development process, understand that it's not like we start off with a fixed pool of issues which gets smaller as issues are resolved. For a relatively large project like Drupal, on-going development will inevitably introduce new issues. But if you take a look at the issue logs, the issues have been steadily trending downward since we started, and RC1 was finally released on October 7.

I first took a peek at Drupal 8 over a year ago when it was at alpha9 just out of curiosity. At that time in my career, I was barely getting the hang of Drupal 7, so I didn't really explore very much beyond clicking around the interface and trying to create some content. With RC1 fresh out of the oven, and looking pretty good to me, I figured it'd be a good time to go through the process of building a Drupal 8 site and documenting the experience. Because, why not?

1. **Download the required Drupal 8 files**  
    There are two ways to do this. You can download the files from [Drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/node/3060/release) and extract them into your local development manually. My preferred method is via Drush. If you're not using Drush, I highly suggest it. Instructions for getting up and running with Drush can be found [here]({{ site.url }}/blog/team-drupal-development#installing-drush). Make sure you're using at least version 7 as Drupal 8 doesn't work with earlier versions of Drush.

    <p class="no-margin">Navigate to wherever you store your local development sites and run the following:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-bash">drush dl drupal-8 --select</code></pre>
    I suppose you could go for the dev version, but the latest supported version will be fine as well.
2. **Run the install script**  
    Navigate to the base url of your site and you should see something like this:

    <picture>
      <source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/drupal-8/install-lg-1248.jpg 2x, {{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/drupal-8/install-lg-640.jpg 1x" sizes="60vw">
      <source srcset="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/drupal-8/install-sm-766.jpg 2x, {{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/drupal-8/install-sm-480.jpg 1x" sizes="90vw">
      <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/drupal-8/install-sm-480.jpg" alt="Install Drupal 8">
    </picture>

    The entire process doesn't deviate from Drupal 7 very much, and almost all the fields to be filled are exactly the same. It's just a slightly different look and feel in terms of UI.

    According to the [official documentation](https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core!INSTALL.txt/8), Drupal will create the `settings.php` and `services.yml` files during installation, but if it can't, it will prompt you to do so manually. If you do get this prompt, it's highly likely that your web server does not have permissions to write to the `sites/default` folder. If you don't feel like `chown`-ing anything, you can move on to the next three steps.

    Depending on how your local machine is set up, you'll have to allow your web server to have write permissions to the *sites/default* folder. For my machine, I was using the default Apache that came with OS X, so I changed ownership of the folder to `_www`, which was the default Apache user (modify accordingly if you're using something different). If you're using MAMP, you can follow the instructions from [this article](http://ifmeister.com/mamp-file-permissions-for-a-local-development-environment/) by [ifmeister](http://ifmeister.com/). 

3. **Adjust folder permissions for install**  
    Drupal needs to modify the `settings.php` and `services.yml` file during installation. It also needs to be able to create the *files* folder. Modify the permissions of the *sites/default* folder so Drupal can write to it:
    <pre><code class="language-bash">chmod a+w sites/default</code></pre>
    This command changes the permissions on that folder to allow everyone to write to it.
4. **Create the services.php and services.yml files**  
    Make a copy of the `default.services.yml` and the `default.settings.php` file as follows (*assuming you're in the sites/default folder already*):
    <pre><code class="language-bash">cp default.services.yml services.yml</code></pre>
    <pre><code class="language-bash">cp default.settings.php settings.php</code></pre>
    <p class="no-margin">Modify the permissions of the settings.php file so Drupal can write to it during the setup process.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-bash">chmod a+w settings.php</code></pre>
5. **Adjust file and folder permissions**  
    If you had to go through steps 3 and 4, then when the site is done installing, you'll most likely get a warning message like so:

    <picture>
      <source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/drupal-8/permissions-lg-1280.jpg 2x, {{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/drupal-8/permissions-lg-640.jpg 1x" sizes="60vw">
      <source srcset="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/drupal-8/permissions-sm-738.jpg 2x, {{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/drupal-8/permissions-sm-480.jpg 1x" sizes="90vw">
      <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/drupal-8/permissions-sm-480.jpg" alt="Permissions">
    </picture>

    Resolve the issue by changing the permissions on those files back to a secure state:
    <pre><code class="language-bash">chmod go-w sites/default/settings.php</code></pre>
    <pre><code class="language-bash">chmod go-w sites/default
6. **Optional setup for local development**  
    This is optional but it's really good practice to do so. You can make a local settings.php file to distinguish server configurations and other settings between your local development environment and your production environment. 
    Make a copy of the `settings.php` file and name it `settings.local.php`. On the `settings.php` file, uncomment these lines and move them to the bottom of the file:
    <pre><code class="language-php"> # if (file_exists(__DIR__ . '/settings.local.php')) {
    #   include __DIR__ . '/settings.local.php';
    # }</code></pre>
    <p class="no-margin">On the <code>settings.local.php</code> page, if your site is drupal8.dev, for example, set up your trusted host patterns.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-php">$settings['trusted_host_patterns'] = array(
      '^drupal8\.dev$',
      '^www\.drupal8\.dev$',
      '^localhost$',
    );</code></pre>

<p class="no-margin">Your new Drupal 8 site should be ready for tinkering. Just double check everything is set up correctly by reviewing the <em>Status report</em> page. There shouldn't be any warnings or errors. If so, you gotta resolve them. The good part about using Drush to install Drupal 8 is that you can update Drupal with this handy command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">drush up drupal</code></pre>
<p class="no-margin">You can also check for updates for all modules, including core, with this command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">drush pm-updatestatus</code></pre>
<p class="no-margin">If you want to exclude a module from being updated, you can lock it with the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">drush pm-update --lock=MODULE_NAME --lock-message="LOCK_MESSAGE"</code></pre>
<p class="no-margin">I ran into some errors when I tried to running updates via Drush, and it was because my version of Drush was not updated. Not sure if this is only an issue for people on the latest dev version (8.0-dev) of Drush though. I had installed Drush using Composer so to resolve that issue I updated my version of Drush using the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">composer global update</code></pre>

I'm going to stop now before this turns into a post on using Drush, but for a comprehensive reference, you should check out the aptly named [Drush Commands](http://drushcommands.com/) website. Have fun with Drupal 8!
