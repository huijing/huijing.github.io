*This is almost a live recap of my tour of South-east Asia (and Hong Kong) this month (September 2017) and will be updated as things chug along. There's also a long introductory passage about public speaking, skip if you're not interested.*

### 15 days, 7 talks, 5 countries

## About speaking at conferences

How would you feel if you're given the opportunity to talk about one of your favourite things in front of a large group of people? For the little group of people who have attended [Talk.CSS](https://singaporecss.github.io) before (I LOVE you all), it seems like I'm pretty okay with public speaking, and honestly, I generally am. But an “official” event, like a conference (or anything with a budget, actually), does feel different.

I know that Chris and I often joke that we're flying blind when it comes to Talk.CSS, and that's largely true, and we do a lot of improvisation and ad-libbing for that, but meet-ups are generally quite casual and relaxed. Conferences (and events with a budget), at least to me, come with a greater responsibility and an air of professionalism.

Professionalism is NOT something that you'd usually associate me with. If you've met me, you know this. Monkey is probably a closer association. But I do have a “adult-mode” switch that I can, and will, turn on when the need arises. Conferences (and events with a budget) are situations that require some serious adulting.

My first full length talk took place this year at the inaugural [Webconf.Asia](https://webconf.asia) in Hong Kong back in June. The speaker line-up included well-known and experienced speakers like [Bruce Lawson](http://www.brucelawson.co.uk/), [Heydon Pickering](http://www.heydonworks.com/) and [Andrew Betts](https://trib.tv/) (just to name a few). I think I came after [Dietrich Ayala](https://metafluff.com/) (another powerhouse speaker), and I was way more nervous than I thought I would be.

Luckily, once I started, the nerves started to fade. I think nerding out about CSS makes me so happy that it overrides any other emotion I may be feeling at that time. It's almost the same as when you're “in the zone” when playing basketball.

The first time I was flown out of Asia for a talk was for [pitercss conference](https://pitercss.com/) in Saint Petersburg. I'd never even been anywhere close to Europe before, so I chose to fly out a week before the conference just to spend more time there.

The conference was amazingly well-organised, and the turnout was fantastic. Words are insufficient to describe the experience, but there will be video released later so check back for the link. Met so many wonderful people here, like [Vadim Makeev](https://twitter.com/pepelsbey_), [Aga Naplocha](http://aganaplocha.com/) and the Viennese Mafia of [Eva Lettner](https://twitter.com/eva_trostlos), [Andrey Okonetchnikov](http://okonet.ru/) and [Manuel Matuzovic](http://matuzo.at/).

I've had the privilege to do quite a bit of speaking this year, and I'm so grateful to every organiser who chose to take a chance on me, a literal no-name speaker, and all the audience members who came up to me after to chat and tell me they enjoyed my session. It really means a lot to me.

There are a lot of developers from South-east Asia who do great work, it's just that there isn't that much visibility on them. I don't often see speakers from my region in international conferences, and I do feel an added responsibility to represent us in the best possible light.

Speaking [FFC8](http://2017.formfunctionclass.com/) is definitely going to rank as one of my top experiences ever. First of all, FFC5 was my first ever conference as an attendee, and I truly experienced Filipino hospitality at its best. This time I was attending as a speaker, presenting a brand new talk about CSS layouts, AND I had the ridiculous idea of doing a small snippet of live-coding on stage.

    <figcaption>Wondering what past me was thinking when I thought live-coding was a good idea, haha (joking...a little bit)</figcaption>

Even though I rehearsed the talk a number of times, there were no guarantees that things wouldn't go wrong and there was a bit of a snag in terms of the set up. But I changed how the code was presented at the last minute so there was way less typing involved. Really relieved things didn't go badly <span class="emoji" role="img" tabindex="0" aria-label="relieved face">&#x1F60C;</span>.

What I did not expect, was the overwhelming response when I finished my session (a few people at the back actually stood up <span class="emoji" role="img" tabindex="0" aria-label="smiling face with heart-eyes">&#x1F60D;</span>). I was just hoping that the audience wouldn't find my talk boring (because I have had people fall asleep in front my face, <span class="emoji" role="img" tabindex="0" aria-label="person shrugging">&#x1F937;</span>) so this was amazing. It might have also been the fact that I managed to weave in Beyoncé into the talk somehow <span class="emoji" role="img" tabindex="0" aria-label="smiling face with sunglasses">&#x1F60E;</span>, so I would also like to thank Queen Bey for this successful talk.

There are [lots of photos](https://www.facebook.com/171813495550/photos/?tab=album&album_id=10159393074875551) of the conference on Facebook, and here's a highlight video.

## <span class="emoji" role="img" tabindex="0" aria-label="Singapore">&#x1F1F8;&#x1F1EC;</span> @ Mozilla Dev Roadshow Singapore

Landed back home for a couple days and also the very first stop of the Mozilla Developer Roadshow. Because Singapore is my home base, I naturally strong-armed everyone I knew to show up for this. Why I still have friends left is a mystery to me <span class="emoji" role="img" tabindex="0" aria-label="smiling face with horns">&#x1F608;</span>.

The line-up for the Singapore stop was packed, and we had THE [Jeremy Keith](https://adactio.com/) doing what I personally think is one of the most inspirational tech talks I've ever heard, on Evaluating Technologies. And to hear it live was such a wonderful experience.

My session actually stuck between two of the biggest names in web development, Jeremy Keith and [Vitaly Friedman of Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/), so forgive me if I was just a little bit stressed. AND my iPad, which was a pretty critical part of my talk setup, decided it was the best time to have a hardware failure.

But the advantage of being at home is that I was surrounded by familiar faces and managed to cobble together a temporary solution, thanks to my shifu, [Michael Cheng](http://coderkungfu.com/), who generously just lent me his iPhone instead. Michael, you awesomez!

Jeremy wasn't joining us for the rest of the trip and we had to say goodbye at the end of the event. But I did manage to hang out with everyone to nerd out about the web in general the night before. We even had an action item to file a bug, because Vitaly, [Markus Seyfferth](https://twitter.com/indysigner) and I concluded that Chrome had a bug with CSS grid for print stylesheets.

Jeremy also suggested to do this recap of the Roadshow experience and so I'm writing this blog post <span class="emoji" role="img" tabindex="0" aria-label="person gesturing ok">&#x1F646;</span>. The talk that I did this time was a variant of the one I did at FFC, but Bruce Lee replaced Beyoncé. I also think this is the first time a lot of my friends have seen me turn on “adult mode”, so that was kinda fun. [Elisha Tan](http://elishatan.com/) (the superwoman running [TechLadies](http://www.techladies.co/)) said it best:
