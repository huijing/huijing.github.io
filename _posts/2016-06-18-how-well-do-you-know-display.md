*This article has been translated to Japanese by Kana Takahashi on [POSTD](http://postd.cc/how-well-do-you-know-display/).*

The *display* property is one of the most important CSS properties we use for layout. Most of us would have used `block`, `inline` and `none`. `table` and `inline-block` are also quite common. The new darling is definitely `flex`, because it's a display property that was created specifically for layout. The upcoming `grid` (currently still being actively worked on) is another layout-specific property that we'll soon have in our arsenal as well.

This post grew much longer than I initially expected so feel free to skip to a subsection if you wish. Though I would really appreciate it if you took the time to read the whole post <span class="emoji" role="img" tabindex="0" aria-label="grinning face with smiling eyes">&#x1F601;</span>.

Through my experience of building various responsive designs, I learnt a lot about the *display* and *position* properties, how they work and how they can be combined with media queries to achieve the desired layouts. I'll briefly cover each value, and also reminisce about a few responsive components I built previously that utilised *display* quite heavily.

We can't talk about *display* without mentioning something called a [box tree](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-display/#box-tree). Basically the browser parses CSS and renders it by generating a box tree, which represents the formatting structure of the rendered document. The *display* property defines the box's display type. 

The topic of how browsers render stuff on the screen is a really fascinating one and I highly suggest reading [How Browsers Work: Behind the scenes of modern web browsers](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/internals/howbrowserswork/) by [Talia Garsiel](http://taligarsiel.com/). Another must-read is [Evolution of CSS Layout: 1990s to the Future](http://fantasai.inkedblade.net/weblog/2012/css-layout-evolution/) by [Fantasai](http://fantasai.inkedblade.net/), who works on CSS specifications at W3C. It's actually a talk she gave at the [Emerging Technologies for the Enterprise](http://2016.phillyemergingtech.com/2012/) conference, but there's a full transcript if video is not your thing.

## Those we know quite well already

Fun fact: the *display* values we use all the time are actually short-hand. For example, `block` is actually short-hand for `block flow`. Refer to the [specification](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-display/#propdef-display) for full list.

All elements have a default *display* value, but they can be overridden by explicitly setting the *display* value to something else.

### display: none;

Removes the element and its children from the normal document flow. The document is rendered as if the element was never there to begin with, which means the space it occupied is collapsed. The content of the element is also ignored by screen readers.

### display: inline;

<img srcset="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/display/inline-480.jpg 480w, {{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/display/inline-640.jpg 640w, {{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/display/inline-960.jpg 960w, {{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/display/inline-1280.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, (max-width: 960px) 75vw, 640px" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/display/inline-640.jpg" alt="Inline elements" />

The element generates one or more inline boxes. Inline-level elements take up, as the name suggests, as much space on the line as its tags define. Can be considered the complement to block-level elements.

### display: block;

<img srcset="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/display/block-480.jpg 480w, {{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/display/block-640.jpg 640w, {{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/display/block-960.jpg 960w, {{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/display/block-1080.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, (max-width: 960px) 60vw, 25em" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/display/block-640.jpg" alt="Block elements" />

The element generates a block level box. All block-level elements start on a new line and, unless otherwise specified, stretches to width of its container. 

### display: list-item;

An element rendered as a list-item behaves exactly like that of a block-level element, but it also generates a marker box, which can be styled by the *list-style* property. Only `<li>` elements have the default value of `list-item`. Usually used to reset `<li>` elements back to their default behaviour.

### display: inline-block;

<p data-height="460" data-theme-id="9162" data-slug-hash="PNMxXL" data-default-tab="result" data-user="huijing" data-embed-version="2" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/huijing/pen/PNMxXL/">CSS Display property</a> by Chen Hui Jing (<a href="http://codepen.io/huijing">@huijing</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>

The element generates a block level box, but the entire box behaves like an inline element. Try it opening the above example on [CodePen](http://codepen.io/huijing/pen/PNMxXL/) and adjusting your window width, it'll make more sense that way.

### A responsive numeric stepper

One of the components I had to build was a numeric stepper for selecting different types of passengers. I got a static photoshop file with 1 mobile layout and 1 desktop layout. But there were all the in-between widths that weren't accounted for which "broke" the layout. 

It was mainly due to the text in parenthesis that didn't collapse nicely. So I had to toss in a bunch of media queries to adjust the width and display of the relevant elements at different widths. Check out [full-sized Codepen](http://codepen.io/huijing/full/LZPNYo/) to see how the component responds at different window widths.

## Remember them table-based layouts?

There are a set of *display* values that allow your elements to behave just like HTML tables. My fellow Singapore-based developer [Colin Toh](https://twitter.com/p0larBoy) wrote [a great post on the display: table property](http://colintoh.com/blog/display-table-anti-hero), which you should really check out.

Although most of us no longer use table-based layouts, `display: table` is still pretty useful in certain cases. For example, if you wanted to have tables only on wider layouts, but retain a typical block layout on smaller widths. This can be achieved with a combination of media queries and *display* (with some pseudo-elements thrown in for good measure), just resize this window to see how it works.

<div class="table display">
  <div class="tr">
    <div class="th td">table</div>
    <div class="td">Corresponds to the <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> HTML element. It defines a block-level box.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="tr">
    <div class="th td">table-header-group</div>

## New kids on the block

[Tab Atkins Jr.](), the primary author of the Flexbox and Grid specifications, made a salient point about these new layout-specific display modes.

> Flexbox is for one-dimensional layouts - anything that needs to be
laid out in a straight line (or in a broken line, which would be a
single straight line if they were joined back together).  
Grid is for two-dimensional layouts.  It can be used as a low-powered
flexbox substitute (we're trying to make sure that a single-column/row
grid acts very similar to a flexbox), but that's not using its full
power.  
- Tab Atkins Jr. to [www-style](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2013May/0114.html)

Something to keep in mind as you adopt these new CSS layouts in your work, and are confused about when to use which.

### display: flex;

The introduction of the flexbox layout mode, or CSS Flexible Box, marks the first time we have a specification that is really meant for laying out content in the browser. Laying out content on the web has evolved quite a bit since HTML was first introduced. When designers wanted to have some creative layout, the first technique used was nesting HTML tables, or what we refer to as table-based layouts.

And when CSS started to pick up, we moved over to float-based layouts, by nesting our content in different divs to float them around to get the desired effect. Float-based layouts are still very common but with flexbox being fully supported by all current browsers as of time of writing, I think it won't be too long before flexbox and grid, which will be covered later, become the prevailing method for layout.

I'm going to reference Scott Vandehey's article [What IS Flexbox?](http://spaceninja.com/2015/08/24/what-is-flexbox/), where he asks Tab Atkins Jr. about the history of Flexbox. The earliest draft for the specification is [dated July 23, 2009](https://www.w3.org/TR/2009/WD-css3-flexbox-20090723/) but discussions started a few years before that. 

However, nothing was formally structured and the various browser vendors sort of implemented flexbox but didn't really follow the specification. Which is why the flexbox syntax became pretty messy (and still is when it comes to backward compatibility on older browsers).

The flexbox model is very powerful, and because it can do a lot, some effort is required to fully understand how it works and how to use it. Both flexbox and grid require full-length articles to cover in depth, so I'll list my go-to resources for flexbox here:

![Flexbox diagram]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/display/flex-diagram.svg "Flexbox diagram")

By declaring `display: flex` on an element, it becomes a flex container, and its child elements become flex items. This does not cascade further, meaning the flex properties do not extend to the element's grandchildren. Both the flex container and flex items have their own respective flex properties.

### display: grid;

For anything related to the Grid layout, I always refer to [Rachel Andrew](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/), whom I regard as the guru of CSS grids. She has been spearheading the effort to increase awareness about this new display property through her [talks](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/presentations), [articles and tutorials](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/writing).

CSS grid gives us a way to create grid systems and control the positioning of grid items purely through CSS, a clear separation of concerns from HTML. When used together with media queries, CSS grid becomes a powerful addition to your tool-belt when it comes to designing and building flexible layouts.

The current [CSS Grid Layout Module Level 1](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-grid/) we have now started off as a [working draft in 2011](http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-css3-grid-layout-20110407/). Like flexbox, this specification came about from the growing need to have a proper method for laying out content on the web without compromising the semantics of HTML.

Note that CSS grid is not officially implemented in any browser, although Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer support an older version of the specification behind the `-ms-` prefix. This is not surprising because a majority of the editors for the original grid specification were from Microsoft. 

After the messy implementation of the flexbox specification, the development of CSS grids is taking a different approach. Browser vendors make use of vendor prefixes to add experimental features to browsers for developers to test out. This helps with the process of refining the specification and work out any kinks before they become official. 

Instead of doing that, CSS grid has developed behind a flag. It has to be [manually enabled by developers](https://igalia.github.io/css-grid-layout/enable.html). In Chrome and Opera, navigate to `chrome://flags` and `opera://flags` respectively, and enable "experimental web platform features." For Firefox, navigate to `about:config` and set `layout.css.grid.enabled` and `layout.css.grid-template-subgrid-value.enabled` to true.

To try to cover grid in this short subsection is really doing the specification a disservice because the totality of what it can do is huge. Please do read through the following resources and experiment around with CSS grids. In fact, you can go to [Grid by Example](http://gridbyexample.com/) right now and access links to various CodePens that demonstrate how to use CSS grids for all kinds of use-cases.

## The relatively obscure and experimental

### display: run-in;

Now this is a fun one I hadn't heard of until I started reading the [CSS Display specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/). And I also uncovered the 2010 article, [CSS Run-in Display Value](https://css-tricks.com/run-in/) by [Chris Coyier](http://chriscoyier.net/). Unfortunately, it seems that browser vendors are not fond of this specification at all and it has since been removed from all browsers, so you can think of this as an alternate reality specification. <span class="kaomoji">¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯</span>

Theoretically, if you set an element's *display* property to `run-in`, it renders as a **run-in box**. The use-case is to have a native method to create run-in headings, which in graphic design parlance is a heading positioned on the same line as the next line of body copy.

You could use floats to achieve a similar effect, but it is sort of a hack-ish method. Lining up the baseline of the header with the body copy is quite challenging, as you have to tweak the font-size of the header and the line-height of the body copy until they match up. And there may be situations where the header just 'catches' more than a single line.

If you want to use `display: inline` on the header instead, it won't work unless you nest the header element in the paragraph element of body copy (because `p` is a block element), and that is semantically incorrect. So I personally would have liked to see this implemented, but I suppose the browser vendors have more high priority specifications to worry about at the moment.

### display: ruby;

This particular property needs an introduction to the &lt;ruby&gt; element for it to make sense to you. In a nutshell, there is an element for displaying annotations alongside a base line of text, usually to help with pronunciation. They're a pretty common sight for East Asian languages, like Chinese or Japanese. Most of the articles I came across during my research were dated around 2010, so I wrote about the [2016 state of HTML &lt;ruby&gt;]({{ site.url }}/blog/html-ruby/).

There are some parallels between `display: ruby;` and `display: table;`, but the specification strongly discourages applying ruby display values to non-ruby elements like `span` to display ruby text. Rather, we should markup our content using the HTML ruby elements so screen readers and non-CS renderers can interpret the ruby structures.

<div class="table display">
  <div class="tr">
    <div class="th td">ruby</div>
    <div class="td">Corresponds to the <code>&lt;ruby&gt;</code> HTML element. It generates a ruby container box, which establishes a ruby formatting context for child elements marked as internal ruby boxes.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="tr">
    <div class="th td">ruby-base</div>
    <div class="td">Corresponds to the <code>&lt;rb&gt;</code> HTML element. An internal ruby box in the ruby formatting context.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="tr">
    <div class="th td">ruby-text</div>
    <div class="td">Corresponds to the <code>&lt;rt&gt;</code> HTML element. An internal ruby box in the ruby formatting context.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="tr">
    <div class="th td">ruby-base-container</div>
    <div class="td">Corresponds to the <code>&lt;rbc&gt;</code> HTML element. An internal ruby box in the ruby formatting context.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="tr">
    <div class="th td">ruby-text-container</div>
    <div class="td">Corresponds to the <code>&lt;rtc&gt;</code> HTML element. An internal ruby box in the ruby formatting context.</div>
  </div>
</div>

### display: contents;

> The element itself does not generate any boxes, but its children and pseudo-elements still generate boxes as normal. For the purposes of box generation and layout, the element must be treated as if it had been replaced with its children and pseudo-elements in the document tree.  
—CSS Display Module Level 3

What the specification is trying to say is that, when you set `display: contents` on an element, it will disappear from the DOM but all its children remain and take up the space it occupied. Unfortunately, this specification is only supported by Firefox for now. Resize the [full size CodePen](http://codepen.io/huijing/full/wWWzmd/) in Firefox to get a feel of how it works.

I've managed to uncover 2 articles that talk about this display property thus far, [Firefox is releasing support for CSS display: contents](https://samrueby.com/2015/02/09/firefox-is-releasing-support-for-css-display-contents/) by [Sam Rueby](https://samrueby.com/) and [Vanishing boxes with display contents](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/archives/2016/01/29/vanishing-boxes-with-display-contents/) by [Rachel Andrew](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/). Rachel Andrew also presents a fantastic use-case for this property with flex-items. Do check out both articles.

## Wrapping up

Whew, that ended up being way longer than I initially expected. So a big thank you if you actually read the whole thing. I'm really excited about the new options we'll have very soon to create unique layouts without having to resort to hacks, and I hope this post will encourage you to learn more about CSS layouts as well.
