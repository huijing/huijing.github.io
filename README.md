# Source code for website

The website is built on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and makes use of [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) as its task runner. [Prism](http://prismjs.com/) is used for syntax highlighting.

*Update: after a good 1992 days (if I had waited a week, it would have been 2000 days, oh well), this Jekyll version of the site hosted on GitHub Pages will be retired. New version which looks almost exactly the same [here](https://github.com/huijing/personal-website) (at the same URL). You're not supposed to SEE the difference.*
