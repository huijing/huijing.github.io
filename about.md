####So who are you?
My name is Chen Hui Jing. I first dipped my toe into the waters of web development when I built my first HTML website in 2008 for the Malaysia Basketball Association. 

From there, I discovered the existence of content management systems and migrated the site over to Drupal. I stopped working on the site a year later and put my web development journey on hold (the original site no longer exists either). 

After a 4-year sabbatical (from web development), I decided to restart this journey by diving in head-first this time. In September of 2013, I got a job in the web industry and this website chronicles my experiences as I learn new things, fail spectacularly and make cool stuff along the way.

####Anything not related to the web?
Sure. I love playing basketball and did so full-time for 6 years until the end of 2011. I still play recreationally now and will continue to do so until my legs say otherwise.

I also love to draw, though I do less of it now. At one point in time, I customised canvas sneakers for friends and some random clients under the name FUZN designs. The [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/fuzndesigns?fref=ts) still exists, though on an indefinite hiatus.

I play a lot of video games as well, mostly on my PC now since I built my own gaming rig in 2012 (It's still running beautifully, might I add). I plan to get a PS3 (that is not a typo) to play a bunch of exclusives that have been on my wishlist for years. 

Oh, and I cycle everywhere on my trusty second-hand Muji commuter bicycle.

####So how was this site built?
With blood, sweat and tears! Nah, I'm just kidding.

This is a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) site, hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). It was built after months of procrastination and hours upon hours of pressing ⌘-⇧-R, resizing windows, googling and of course, actual coding. 

Since Jekyll is a static site generator, everything here is HTML, CSS and JS. 

No PHP, no Ruby, no Python, nilch.
